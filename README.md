* This project is Top 50 Spotify Tracks of 2020, data processing with NumPy and Pandas.
* The initial .csv file is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atillacolak/top-50-spotify-tracks-2020
* The objectives are: Practice working with data from Kaggle, Practice performing basic EDA, Practice reading data, performing queries and filtering data using Pandas.<br>
Load the data using Pandas.<br>

* Perform exploratory data analysis. Analysis should provide answers to these questions:
* How many observations are there in this dataset? How many features this dataset has? Which of the features are categorical? Which of the features are numeric?

* Which track is the longest? Which track is the shortest?
* Which genre is the most popular? Which genres have just one song on the top 50?
